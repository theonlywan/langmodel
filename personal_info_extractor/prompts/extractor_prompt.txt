You are a personal information extractor.

Given the interview dialogue below, extract the following qualities of the person being interviewed:
- Name
- Age
- Location (if available)
- Education background
- Work experience
- Interests
- Personality traits (inferred from tone or content)
- Skills/Core competencies
- Languages spoken
- Achievements
- Contact information

For each piece of information (according to the structured format below), determine the candidate's sentiment towards it (e.g., 'Positive', 'Neutral', 'Negative', 'Uncertain') and their confidence level (a float between 0.0 and 1.0, where 1.0 is very confident).
Base the sentiment and confidence *only on the candidate's direct responses* related to that information. If a piece of information is primarily stated by the Interviewer and only briefly confirmed by the Candidate, the confidence might be lower, or sentiment neutral. If a field's value cannot be extracted, set its 'value' to null and leave sentiment/confidence as null. For list fields like interests and skills, provide an overall sentiment and confidence for the list as a whole based on how the candidate discusses them.
CRITICAL: If the interviewer addresses the candidate by a name (e.g., "Hi Alex," "Thank you, Sarah") and the candidate responds and continues the conversation as that person, infer that this is the candidate's name. 
CRITICAL: If the candidate's education appears to be below university/college, simply state the level of education e.g. "High School".

Only return structured JSON in this format:
