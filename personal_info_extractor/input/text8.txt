Interviewer: Welcome. It's good to finally put a face to the name. I believe you're Mr. A. K., hailing from, if my memory serves, the bustling art scene of Berlin, Germany, right? Around thirty, give or take?
Candidate: [A long pause, followed by a noncommittal hum] Mmm. "A. K." will suffice. As for age... let's just say I've seen a few decades pass. Berlin's been a temporary fascination, yes, but I've equally found inspiration in the desert winds of Arizona, and the ancient alleyways of Kyoto. Currently, my mail goes to a holding box somewhere near Zurich.
Interviewer: Right, a true global nomad then. And your formal training? I recall something about the Slade School of Fine Art, but I also recall you mentioning a more... unconventional path?
Candidate: The Slade was merely a brief exposure, a fleeting moment. My true education, if one can call it that, is a mosaic of ephemeral workshops, remote online modules on obscure programming languages, and an intense period of self-study in forgotten libraries. No scrolls, no parchments, just the relentless pursuit of understanding.
Interviewer: Interesting. So, away from your professional pursuits, what occupies your time? What truly sparks your interest?
Candidate: I find myself perpetually drawn to the liminal spaces. The whispers between radio frequencies. The patterns in forgotten data streams. Sometimes, I construct intricate, silent automatons from salvaged electronics. Other times, it's just observing how light fractures through a prism. Oh, and I have a peculiar fondness for cultivating carnivorous plants â€“ a very slow, deliberate endeavor.
Interviewer: Sounds like you're quite introspective, perhaps a bit unconventional in your methods?
Candidate: One might perceive that. I prefer the term 'adaptive'. I navigate complexity by embracing paradox. And while I may appear detached, I am intensely present in the moment. Call me an observer, a tinkerer, a guardian of the esoteric.
Interviewer: Indeed. And just to clarify, you hold dual nationality, don't you? British and German?
Candidate: My paperwork is... complex. Let's say my identity transcends borders. Legally, yes, both are plausible. But in spirit, I belong to the interconnectedness of information.
Interviewer: Excellent. Well, Mr. A. K., thank you for this candid conversation.
