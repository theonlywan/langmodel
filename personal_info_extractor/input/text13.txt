Interviewer: Good morning, Michael. Thank you for making the time. What drew you to medicine, specifically?

Candidate: Good morning! It's actually a combination of personal experience and a deep fascination with human biology. My younger sister had a chronic illness when she was very young, and seeing the dedication and impact of her doctors really inspired me. Beyond that, I'm incredibly curious about how the human body works at a cellular level, and I find the problem-solving aspect of diagnosis very appealing.

Interviewer: That's a powerful motivation. What steps have you taken to explore your interest in medicine so far?

Candidate: I've done a few things. I volunteered at St. Jude's Hospital for six months, assisting nurses in the pediatric ward, which gave me firsthand experience with patient care. I also shadowed a general practitioner for two weeks, observing consultations and understanding the daily life of a doctor. Academically, I've focused heavily on biology and chemistry, and I participated in our school's science olympiad, focusing on biotechnology.

Interviewer: Very proactive. How do you handle high-pressure situations or unexpected challenges? Medical school can be quite demanding.

Candidate: I try to stay calm and methodical. During my time volunteering, there was one instance where a patient's monitor started alarming unexpectedly. My immediate reaction was to alert the nurse and then follow her instructions precisely, staying out of the way but ready to assist. I believe in preparation and then trusting my training and the team around me.

Interviewer: That's a good approach. Finally, how do you see yourself contributing to our university community, beyond your academic pursuits?

Candidate: I'm really keen on continuing my volunteer work, perhaps with a focus on health education initiatives for younger students. I also play the cello, and I'd love to join the university orchestra or a chamber group. I think a balanced life, incorporating service and arts, is crucial for well-being.
