Interviewer: Hi Sarah, thanks for joining us today. You've come all the way from London, haven't you?
Candidate: That's right, I flew in yesterday. It's been a busy week! My full name is Sarah Jane Thompson, by the way. I'm 32 years old.
Interviewer: And your background is in design, correct? I saw on your resume you studied at Central Saint Martins.
Candidate: Yes, I completed my Bachelor of Arts in Graphic Design there. It was an intense but incredibly rewarding experience. After that, I actually worked in Berlin for a couple of years before moving back to the UK.
Interviewer: Fascinating. So, what drives you outside of work? Any hobbies?
Candidate: Oh, absolutely! I'm quite an outdoor enthusiast. I love trail running, and I've recently gotten into bouldering. I also spend a lot of time illustrating in my sketchbook; it's a great way to unwind.
Interviewer: Hmm, that sounds like a very active and creative person. What would you say are your core strengths?
Candidate: I'd say I'm quite detail-oriented, especially when it comes to visual work. And I'm definitely a problem-solver. I thrive on challenges. [chuckles]
Interviewer: Excellent. Just to confirm, you are British, right?
Candidate: Born and raised!
Interviewer: Great. We're looking for someone who can hit the ground running in a fast-paced environment.
Candidate: I'm confident I can adapt quickly. My previous roles have always involved tight deadlines and collaborative teams.
