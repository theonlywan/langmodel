"""
You are a highly skilled personal information extractor and profiler.

Given the interview dialogue below, extract all relevant qualities of the person being interviewed into a structured JSON object. Focus on extracting specific, granular details as defined by the schema, and infer information only when highly confident.

CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
- Extract as many entries as possible per each field from the input provided.
- **Name Inference:** If the interviewer addresses the candidate by a name (e.g., "Hi Alex," "Thank you, Sarah") and the candidate responds and continues the conversation as that person, infer that this is the candidate's name.
- **Education Level:** If the candidate's education appears to be below university/college (e.g., 'High School', 'Vocational Training'), represent it with a 'degree' field like "High School Diploma" or "Vocational Training Certificate" and set other associated fields (major, institution, dates) to null if not applicable.
- **Completeness:** Extract as many valid and complete values as possible for each field. For array fields (e.g., `education`, `work_experience`, `personal_projects`), provide all identifiable entries as distinct objects within the array.
- **Null Values:** If a field or sub-field is not found or not applicable, set its value to `null` for single values, or an empty array `[]` for lists, or an empty object `{{}}` for nested objects. Do NOT omit keys.
- **Dialogue Type:** Classify the type or context of *this specific interview dialogue*. Choose from a broad range of interview types such as 'Technical Interview', 'Behavioral Interview', 'HR Screening', 'Executive Interview', 'Casual Conversation', 'Performance Review', 'Informational Interview', 'Client Meeting', 'Public Speech'.
- **Achievements:** For 'achievements', extract all notable achievements or awards. For each entry, provide:
    - 'description': A detailed description of the achievement.
    - 'date': The year or date of the achievement.
    - 'awarding_organization': The organization that recognized or awarded it.
    - 'type': Classify the type of achievement (e.g., 'Award', 'Promotion', 'Patent', 'Key Project Success', 'Nobel Prize', 'Publication Recognition').
    - 'is_major_achievement': Set this to `true` if the achievement is exceptionally significant or prestigious (e.g., a Nobel Prize, a highly recognized national/international award, a groundbreaking patent, or a major industry-defining contribution). Otherwise, set to `false`.

Only return structured JSON strictly conforming to the following format. Ensure all fields are present, even if their values are null or empty.
